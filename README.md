## What I Learned
Although not taught yet we were given a task to be able to add DELETE /api/notes/:id  to be able to handle DELETE requests by removing it from the db.json file by its unique ID and then rewrite the notes to the db.json file

## Documentation
For the DELETE portion I used the following three documentations
- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/express-js-app-delete-method
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/express-js-application-complete-reference/
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65015000/how-do-i-use-express-js-app-delete-to-remove-a-specific-object-from-an-array

For other documentation i referred to recorded lecture classes and https://expressjs.com/en/api.html
